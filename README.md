#Anagram Validation of two strings

Logic,

Convert both strings to character arrays.
Sort the character arrays in ascending/descending order.
Create two strings out of the two sorted character set arrays.
Compare the strings.
If they are not equal, they are not Anagrams.
if they are equal, they are Anagrams
